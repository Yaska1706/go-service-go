# Go MBV Go 
This is the template I use for kick-starting all my Golang projects.

It is meant to provide some initial structure that is flexible but also lets you get building fast.

## Dependencies
Golang migrate: `brew install golang-migrate`

## Permissions
To use the make command: `make run` you need to give the `go.sh` permission to run. This is done by running this command in your terminal: `chmod +x go.sh` from the root of this directory.

You also need to create a `.env` file that holds all of your environmental variables.
